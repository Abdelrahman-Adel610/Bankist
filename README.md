## 👁️ Overview

The Pig Game is a fun and simple dice game built with js and styled with CSS. 🎨 In this game, two players compete to reach 100 points by rolling dice and accumulating scores. The first player to reach 100 points wins! 🏆 This project showcases the use of React's `useReducer` hook for managing complex state logic.
